# Instructions

Practice using the JavaScript Plotly library.

Go to the 6_exercise_plotly folder. Open the index.html file.  The index.html contains code for the front-end of a web application. Most importantly, the html code contains two <div></div> tags labeled id="plot1" and id="plot2". For this exercise, you do not need to change anything in the index.html file.

Now, go into the javascript_files folder. Your task it to open the plot1.js and plot2.js files in the javascript_files folder and create data visualizations using Plotly. Follow the TODO sections in those two files.
  
When you're finished, there are solution files in the solutions folder.
