# Writing an iterator to load data in chunks (1)
# Another way to read data too large to store in memory in chunks is to read the file in as DataFrames of a certain length, say, 100. For example, with the pandas package (imported as pd), you can do pd.read_csv(filename, chunksize=100). This creates an iterable reader object, which means that you can use next() on it.

# In this exercise, you will read a file in small DataFrame chunks with read_csv(). You're going to use the World Bank Indicators data 'ind_pop.csv', available in your current directory, to look at the urban population indicator for numerous countries and years.

# Import the pandas package
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Initialize reader object: df_reader
df_reader = pd.read_csv('Datasets/world_ind_pop_data.csv', chunksize=10)

# Print two chunks
# print(next(df_reader))
# print(next(df_reader))

# Writing an iterator to load data in chunks (2)
# In the previous exercise, you used read_csv() to read in DataFrame chunks from a large dataset. In this exercise, you will read in a file using a bigger DataFrame chunk size and then process the data from the first chunk.

# To process the data, you will create another DataFrame composed of only the rows from a specific country. You will then zip together two of the columns from the new DataFrame, 'Total Population' and 'Urban population (% of total)'. Finally, you will create a list of tuples from the zip object, where each tuple is composed of a value from each of the two columns mentioned.
# Initialize reader object: urb_pop_reader
urb_pop_reader = pd.read_csv('Datasets/world_ind_pop_data.csv', chunksize = 1000)

# Get the first DataFrame chunk: df_urb_pop
df_urb_pop = next(urb_pop_reader)

# Check out the head of the DataFrame
print(df_urb_pop.head())

# Check out specific country: df_pop_ceb
df_pop_ceb = df_urb_pop[df_urb_pop['CountryCode'] == 'CEB']

# Zip DataFrame columns of interest: pops
pops = zip(df_pop_ceb['Total Population'], df_pop_ceb['Urban population (% of total)'])

# Turn zip object into list: pops_list
pops_list = list(pops)

# Print pops_list
# print(pops_list)

# Writing an iterator to load data in chunks (3)
# You're getting used to reading and processing data in chunks by now. Let's push your skills a little further by adding a column to a DataFrame.

# Starting from the code of the previous exercise, you will be using a list comprehension to create the values for a new column 'Total Urban Population' from the list of tuples that you generated earlier. Recall from the previous exercise that the first and second elements of each tuple consist of, respectively, values from the columns 'Total Population' and 'Urban population (% of total)'. The values in this new column 'Total Urban Population', therefore, are the product of the first and second element in each tuple. Furthermore, because the 2nd element is a percentage, you need to divide the entire result by 100, or alternatively, multiply it by 0.01.

# Code from previous exercise
urb_pop_reader = pd.read_csv('Datasets/world_ind_pop_data.csv', chunksize=1000)
df_urb_pop = next(urb_pop_reader)
df_pop_ceb = df_urb_pop[df_urb_pop['CountryCode'] == 'CEB']
pops = zip(df_pop_ceb['Total Population'], 
           df_pop_ceb['Urban population (% of total)'])
pops_list = list(pops)

# Use list comprehension to create new DataFrame column 'Total Urban Population'
df_pop_ceb['Total Urban Population'] = [int(tup[0]*tup[1]*0.01) for tup in pops_list]

# Plot urban population data
df_pop_ceb.plot(kind='scatter', x='Year', y='Total Urban Population')
# plt.show()

# Writing an iterator to load data in chunks (4)
# In the previous exercises, you've only processed the data from the first DataFrame chunk. This time, you will aggregate the results over all the DataFrame chunks in the dataset. This basically means you will be processing the entire dataset now. This is neat because you're going to be able to process the entire large dataset by just working on smaller pieces of it!
# Initialize reader object: urb_pop_reader
urb_pop_reader = pd.read_csv('Datasets/world_ind_pop_data.csv', chunksize=1000)

# Initialize empty DataFrame: data
data = pd.DataFrame()

# Iterate over each DataFrame chunk
for df_urb_pop in urb_pop_reader:

    # Check out specific country: df_pop_ceb
    df_pop_ceb = df_urb_pop[df_urb_pop['CountryCode'] == 'CEB']

    # Zip DataFrame columns of interest: pops
    pops = zip(df_pop_ceb['Total Population'],
                df_pop_ceb['Urban population (% of total)'])

    # Turn zip object into list: pops_list
    pops_list = list(pops)

    # Use list comprehension to create new DataFrame column 'Total Urban Population'
    df_pop_ceb['Total Urban Population'] = [int(tup[0] * tup[1] * 0.01) for tup in pops_list]
    
    # Append DataFrame chunk to data: data
    data = data.append(df_pop_ceb)

# Plot urban population data
data.plot(kind='scatter', x='Year', y='Total Urban Population')
# plt.show()

# Writing an iterator to load data in chunks (5)
# This is the last leg. You've learned a lot about processing a large dataset in chunks. In this last exercise, you will put all the code for processing the data into a single function so that you can reuse the code without having to rewrite the same things all over again.

# You're going to define the function plot_pop() which takes two arguments: the filename of the file to be processed, and the country code of the rows you want to process in the dataset.

# Because all of the previous code you've written in the previous exercises will be housed in plot_pop(), calling the function already does the following:

# Loading of the file chunk by chunk,
# Creating the new column of urban population values, and
# Plotting the urban population data.
# That's a lot of work, but the function now makes it convenient to repeat the same process for whatever file and country code you want to process and visualize!
# Define plot_pop()
def plot_pop(filename, country_code):

    # Initialize reader object: urb_pop_reader
    urb_pop_reader = pd.read_csv(filename, chunksize=1000)

    # Initialize empty DataFrame: data
    data = pd.DataFrame()
    
    # Iterate over each DataFrame chunk
    for df_urb_pop in urb_pop_reader:
        # Check out specific country: df_pop_ceb
        df_pop_ceb = df_urb_pop[df_urb_pop['CountryCode'] == country_code]

        # Zip DataFrame columns of interest: pops
        pops = zip(df_pop_ceb['Total Population'],
                    df_pop_ceb['Urban population (% of total)'])

        # Turn zip object into list: pops_list
        pops_list = list(pops)

        # Use list comprehension to create new DataFrame column 'Total Urban Population'
        df_pop_ceb['Total Urban Population'] = [int(tup[0] * tup[1] * 0.01) for tup in pops_list]
    
        # Append DataFrame chunk to data: data
        data = data.append(df_pop_ceb)

    # Plot urban population data
    data.plot(kind='scatter', x='Year', y='Total Urban Population')
    plt.show()

# Set the filename: fn
fn = 'Datasets/world_ind_pop_data.csv'

# Call plot_pop for country code 'CEB'
plot_pop(fn,'CEB')

# Call plot_pop for country code 'ARB'
plot_pop(fn,'ARB')
